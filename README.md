This is a React Application for the video game "League of Legends" that gives users a randomized Character to play in game. This feature was removed by Riot Games from the client so I created this to let players still have access outside of the game. 

You can also customize specific lists for each role in the game, and block certain heroes from your pool of randomized characters.
